# iTunes_search

iPhone app that searches for albums in the iTunes music catalogue.

The user types a query in a search box (e.g., album/song title or artist name), and the app gets the info from the iTunes API.

It displays the results (album artwork image, title, artist and genre) using a page control that displays a series of horizontal dots at the bottom of the screen, each of which corresponds to a page with a result.

The user can scroll through the results with his fingers, horizontally, left and right.

It uses custom fonts.
